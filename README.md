## Context
This project was conducted by a group of three students following a Python training. 
It is build using differents Python lib and few other things, such as:

Pygame for the GUI
![Pygame](https://github.com/Hidorion/Projet12/blob/master/docs/readme_extras/ "Pygame Logo")
Tiled was used for create maps
![Tiled](https://github.com/Hidorion/Projet12/blob/master/docs/readme_extras/ "Tiled Logo")
Postgres for the DB
![Postgres](https://github.com/Hidorion/Projet12/blob/master/docs/readme_extras/ "Postgres Logo")
PyTMX as map loader for python/pygame


*Second project for us, first as a team!*

## Pre-requisite
To execute correctly our program, you will need the following:
### Minimum (let's go and just run it!):
You will need to have Python installed on your machine, a powershell (on Windows) or any terminal emulator. 

After that, the program is packaged in a virtual environment, so you just need to:
* Activate virtual environment : ./env/scripts/activate.ps1
* If script execution is disabled:
    * Start powershell as administrator
    * Type the command: set-executionpolicy unrestricted
    * Confirm with the "o/y" key as "yes".
* Retrieve all the modules needed by the program with the command: 
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```


### Complete (let's go for just doing what you want!):
You will need to have the minimum config + an IDE, if you want to see more code, debug it or modify it!

## General game infos

### Brief overview of the game:
After landing on the edge of the island following a shipwreck, you had to fight for survival and solve three daunting challenges!
In this sequel, you managed to make your way to the heart of the island thanks to a passage in the rock of a mountain and 



### Main controls:
