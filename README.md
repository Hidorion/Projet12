## Context
This project was conducted by a group of three students following a Python training. *Second project for us, first as a team!*

## Pre-requisite
To execute correctly our program, you will need the following:
#### Minimum (let's go and just run it!):
You will need to have Python installed on your machine, a powershell (on Windows) or any terminal emulator. 

After that, the program is packaged in a virtual environment, so you just need to:
* Activate virtual environment : ./env/scripts/activate.ps1
* If script execution is disabled:
    * Start powershell as administrator
    * Type the command: set-executionpolicy unrestricted
    * Confirm with the "o/y" key as "yes".
* Retrieve all the modules needed by the program with the command: 
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```


#### Complete (let's go for just doing what you want!):
You will need to have the minimum config + an IDE, if you want to see more code, debug it or modify it!
